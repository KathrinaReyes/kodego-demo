                        Frank Lloyd Wright (1967 - 1959) was one of the most famous and influential architects of the 20th century. He is best known for his Prairie Style homes, which were designated to fit in with the natural landscape.
                        One of frank Lloyd Wright's most famous works is the Fallingwater house, which is built over a waterfall in Pennsylvania. The Solomon R. Guggenheim Musuem is another masterpiece of form and function, and a UNESCO Woeld Heritage Site.
                        Throughout his long and prolific career, Frank Lloyd Wright brought American architecture to the forefront.
                        His Visionary creations were strongly influenced by the natural world, and he emphasized craftsmanship while embracing technology'sability to make design accessible to all.

                        Dame Zaha Hadid, (1950 - 2016) known for infusing designs with unexpected forms that challenge physics, studied mathematics before receiving the Diploma Prize in 1977 from the London-baed Architectural Association. She was raised in Baghdad in 1950,amid an era of wealth and development in Iraq, and decided she wanted to be an architect by the age of 11. Her extraordinarily imaginative designs dubbed the "Queen of the Curve."
                        She was the first woman to receive the Pritzker Architecture Prize, in 2004. She received the UK's most prestigious architectural award, the Stirling Prize, in 2010 and 2011.
                        Her buildings included the Heydar Aliyev Centre Baku, Azerbaijan, and the MAXXI musuem of contemporary art and architecture in Rome. Hadid' extraordinary accomplishments were all the more remarkable considering she was working in an industry largely dominated by men.
